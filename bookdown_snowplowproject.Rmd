# Abstract

The objective of this research was to analyze winter weather impacts on traffic speed and safety for arterial roads in Salt Lake City, Utah. This analysis included the correlation of storm severity data, traffic speeds, and crash data. The data were gathered for the 2019-2020 winter season for each snow storm. Storm severity was determined during 15-minute intervals for the duration of the overall storm. For weather days and days with no weather, the difference of speeds was determined and contrasted to speed limits. Storm severity, traffic speed, and crash data were compared and analyzed per storm, day of the week, and time of day to find statistical trends. The results indicated if a storm is low severity or medium severity, traffic speeds are typically faster than days with no weather and faster than the posted speed limits, due to the lower volumes of vehicles on the road. This resulted in no effect on crashes. However, on high severity storms, speeds decreased, and crashes increased. During the PM peak hour, traffic speeds decreased below normal and crashes increased. The AM peak period did not see the same results, as traffic volumes are typically decreased in the morning during a snow storm. These research findings show the correlation of winter weather severity, traffic speeds, and crash data for arterials in the Salt Lake City area. The findings can be used to access impacts of Utah’s current winter weather maintenance programs on arterial roads.

# Introduction {#intro}

Each year, 70 percent of all roadway networks, as well as 70 percent of the population in the United States, experience 5 or more inches of snow (FHWA 2020b). These storms create poor driving conditions, including icy roads and poor visibility. Various studies have been conducted in multiple locations to determine speed reductions. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has found that average speeds decline on snowy and slushy pavements on arterials and freeways. The reduced visibility and traction during a winter storm not only decreases driving speeds, but also increases headway and reduces vehicle acceleration. This leads to a decrease in the effectiveness of traffic signal plans and roadway capacity (FHWA 2020a).

Safety is also of great concern during winter weather conditions. The FHWA reported that each year in the United States, 24 percent of weather-related crashes happen on snowy, slushy, or icy pavement (FHWA 2020b). State Departments of Transportation (DOTs) often partner in various research studies to determine how to improve safety on their networks.

Although research has been done in other snowy states to assess impacts of winter weather on traffic speeds and safety, minimal research has been executed in Utah in these areas. As the population within the state continues to grow, the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) has continued to place great importance on timely maintenance during these winter storms. UDOT’s winter maintenance goal each year is to minimize fatalities and maintain network flow. State officials need accurate studies for this region to know the impacts of their snow removal program on traffic speeds and crash rates to provide safer roads for their citizens.

The objective of this research is to find the impacts of winter weather on traffic speeds and safety in Utah, especially in the Salt Lake City metropolitan area. Five routes were chosen in the Salt Lake Valley to analyze, including West 9000 South, East 9000 South, Redwood Road, 700 East, and Foothill Drive. The data collected are from the 2019-2020 winter weather season. The following sections provide background information of the project, a description of procedures followed, discussion of results found, and conclusions drawn.

# Literature

The effects of winter storms are extensive. Each winter storm event brings costs assumed in travel delay and weather-related crashes. As a winter storm begins, there is typically a reduction in pavement friction due to ice and snow compacted on the roadway. Based on drivers’ perception of the roadway conditions, most users will decrease their travel speeds during winter storm events (Holik et al. 2015). The FHWA has found that average arterial speeds decline by 30 to 40 percent for snowy and slushy pavements. On freeways, speeds can be reduced by 3 to 13 percent in light snow and by 5 to 40 percent in heavy snow (FHWA 2020b). In Baltimore, Minneapolis, St. Paul, and Seattle, speeds were shown to reduce by 5 to 16 percent on average due to snow (Hranac et al. 2006). In addition to decreased speeds, volume and capacity reductions have also been found, as shown in Table 1. 

**Table 1. Traffic Flow Reductions on Freeways due to Winter Weather (FHWA 2020a)**

|Weather Conditions|Freeway Traffic Flow Reductions|--|--|--|
|-------|-----------|-----|------------|--------------|
| |Average Speed (%)|Free Flow Speed (%)|Volume (%)|Capacity (%)|
|Light Rain/Snow|3 - 13|2 - 13|5 - 10|4 - 11|
|Heavy Snow|5 - 40|5 - 64|30 - 44|12 - 27|
|Low Visibility|10 - 12|N/A|N/A|12|

Traffic volumes are also affected during winter storms. When traffic volumes are decreased during a storm, there is a correlation to the impacts on traffic speeds. When there are fewer vehicles on the road, it is more likely that traffic speeds will be closer to normal, even during winter storms. This, however, depends on the severity of the storm. Traffic volumes are reduced at different times of day, with PM peak volumes being impacted less when compared to AM peak volumes. There are fewer drivers out during the AM peak. There is also a large difference in volume during off-peak hours, suggesting drivers will alter their travel if possible (Hanbali 1992). 

With the reduction of traffic speeds during winter weather, travel delay is increased. To the user, traffic congestion can be costly, estimated at 78 billion in user costs per year (Schrank and Lomax 2007). About 15 percent of congestion is due to weather events, leading to almost $12 billion in user costs per year resulting from the weather (Cambridge Systematics Inc. and Texas Transportation Institute 2004). Winter weather affects travel time, speed, and costs for both individuals and businesses.

In addition to speeds, safety is a great concern during winter weather conditions. The FHWA reported that each year in the United States, 24 percent of weather-related crashes happen on snowy, slushy, or icy pavement. Of those crashes, 15 percent occurred during snowfall or sleet, which result in over 1,300 people that are killed and over 116,800 that are injured (FHWA 2020b). These statistics are what drive DOTs to spend millions of dollars on winter maintenance each year.

Using 10 years of data that resulted from weather-related conditions, the FHWA compiled annual average weather-related crash statistics. Both weather and pavement conditions were analyzed with the results shown in Table 2. Based on averages from the 10-year span, each year, 5,891,000 vehicle crashes occur throughout the United States. Of those crashes, 21 percent (1,235,000) are weather-related. Of the weather-related crashes that occurred, 18 percent (222,300) happened in snow or sleet conditions (FHWA 2020a).

Table 2

A variety of studies have been conducted to see when winter weather-related crashes are likely to occur. One study examined the relationship between winter weather precipitation and severity of crashes for 13 cities in the United States from 1996 to 2010 by analyzing crash and weather data. The locations for the study were chosen due to the frequency and type of winter precipitation they experience but did not include Utah. The results of the research showed that injury collision risk increased by 13 percent during winter precipitation compared to a control period. The strongest predictors for crashes were precipitation intensity, time of day, and order of precipitation. Crashes occurred more often during intense precipitation, during the afternoon and evening parts of the day, and during the first three precipitation events of a winter season (Black and Mote 2015).

The data were collected from a variety of sources for this study to analyze storm severity and traffic speeds for arterials in the Salt Lake Valley. These arterials include West 9000 South, East 9000 South, Redwood Road, 700 East, and Foothill Drive. Figure 1 shows the location of the arterials. The data were collected for the 2019-2020 winter weather season. 

**Data Types**

The winter weather data was collected from UDOT’s Road Weather Information System (RWIS) locations. These sites are placed around Utah and are used to help understand weather and road conditions in various locations. Various information is gathered at these sites, such as wind speed, snowfall rate, air temperature, surface temperature, surface status, surface snow depth, and dew point. This information is gathered for each RWIS site every 10 minutes. These values are used by the organization to calculate a Storm Intensity Index (SII). A brief synopsis of these values is shown in Table \@ref(tab:storm-table). 

```{r storm-table}
datasummary_skim(Storm, title = "Distribution of Numeric Variables in Storm Data")
```

These SII values were categorized to show storm severity; “light” was defined as a SII value of less than 0.25, “moderate” was defined as SII values ranging from 0.25 to 1, and “heavy” was defined for any SII value over 1. These definitions for storm severity were given by UDOT weather employees and a summary of the data is shown in Table \@ref(tab:summaryofstormdata).

```{r summaryofstormdata}
datasummary_skim(Storm %>%select("Storm Rating"=Adj_Rating, RWIS_Site), 
                 type="categorical", 
                 title = "Distribution of Categorial Variables in Data")
```

As found from UDOT’s RWIS sites, the data from days that snowfall took place were downloaded from each of the RWIS sites that correlate to selected routes. The data was cleaned up using R. Weather personnel at UDOT suggested which RWIS sites to use for each route, which is included in the code below. Each route was broken into segments by UDOT maintenance sheds, to provide more accurate weather data for each part of a route.

Traffic data were gathered using UDOT’s contract with Iteris through iPeMs. This data are collected with Bluetooth data that can be gathered from certain car brands. Iteris gathers this data for each route and for each 15-minute increment, where the average traffic speed is determined on the created route. The data were collected for each day the RWIS site reported there to be a snow storm. A summary of the data is found in Table \@ref(tab:speed-table). To assess the impacts of these storms on traffic speeds, a sample of normal weather days were taken during the same winter season to find average speeds that were not affected by weather. With this baseline average, the speeds during winter storms were compared and effects were determined. Overall statistical data can be found in Table \@ref(tab:summaryofspeeddata)


```{r speed-table}
datasummary_skim(Speed,
                 title = "Distirbution of Numeric Varaibles in Speed Data")
```

```{r summaryofspeeddata}

datasummary_skim(Speed %>%select(Segment, "Time of Day"=Time_Period, "Weather Type"=Date_Type),
                 type = "categorical",
                 title = "Distribution of Categorical Variables in Speed Data")

```

**Analysis**

The analysis performed was done using the code below. This cleaned up the data and combined the dataset to provide a place for analysis to begin.



```{r ReadData} 
Storm <- read_xlsx("Data/Storm_Severity.xlsx")
Speed <- read_xlsx("Data/iPeMs.xlsx")
```


```{r clean_storms}
storm_hour <- Storm %>%
  mutate(
    date = date(SampleTime),
    hour = hour(SampleTime)
  ) %>%
  group_by(RWIS_Site, date, hour) %>%
  summarise(
    s_intensity = mean(StormIntensityIndex, na.rm = TRUE),
    snowfall = mean(SnowfallRate, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

```{r clean_speeds}
speed_hour <- Speed %>%  mutate(
    date = date(`Date/Time`),
    hour = hour(`Date/Time`)
  ) %>%
  group_by(Segment, date, hour) %>%
  summarise(
    Speed = mean(Speed, na.rm = TRUE),
    Speed_Limit = mean(Speed_Limit, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

```{r crosswalk of speed to weather}
segment_xwalk <- tibble(
  Segment = c("W 9000 S","E 9000 S","Redwood","Redwood","Redwood","700 E","700 E","Foothill"),
  RWIS_Site = c("SR-85@DannonWay","I-15@6200S","I-15@6200S","I-15@500S","I-15@2400S","I-15@6200S","I-15@2400S","I-80@MouthofParleys")
)

segment_xwalk %>%
  left_join(storm_hour, by = "RWIS_Site") %>%
  left_join(speed_hour, by = c("Segment","date","hour"))

```

# Applications

Some _significant_ applications are demonstrated in this chapter.


The datasets were correlated together to find results. Traffic speed data were used to compare normal versus snow days to determine the effect of snow storms on traffic speeds. Storm severity was then compared to weather data to determine the effects of levels of severity on traffic speeds.

A similar analysis was done for crash data. Crash data were compared to weather data to analyze the frequency of crashes per storm severity level. The crash data were also compared with traffic data. The comparison of the three datasets showed the interaction between storm severity, traffic speed, and crash rates. 


##Goal: Compare speed and storm data

Compare normal v weather days with a t-test to find statistical significant differences
