# Methods

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(modelsummary)

```



We describe our methods in this chapter.


Describe what data we have, and what it represents

Table \@ref(tab:storm-table)

```{r ReadData} 
#can put extra options in here, such as a figure title in the chunk options

Storm <- read_xlsx("Data/Storm_Severity.xlsx")
Speed <- read_excel("Data/iPeMs.xlsx")

```

```{r storm-table}
#this is the table for the output data

datasummary_skim(Storm, title = "Distribution of Numeric Variables in Storm Data")
#shows mean, SD, min, median, max, histogram


```

```{r summaryofstormdata}

datasummary_skim(Storm, type="categorical", title = "Distribution of Categorial Variables in Data")
#the title is the caption

```
