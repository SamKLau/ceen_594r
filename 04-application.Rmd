# Applications

Some _significant_ applications are demonstrated in this chapter.

## Example one

## Example two

##Goal: Compare speed and storm data

Compare normal v weather days with a t-test to find statistical significant differences
**Show chart of this

Coorelate dates and times for routes & RWIS sites

Run avg speed per storm severity overall
***Bar chart or table

See variance on routes with speeds at different storm severity
Maybe do another t-test here?
**Table to show one segment and how speed changes over storm severity
